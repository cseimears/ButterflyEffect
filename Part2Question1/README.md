# Arrival Time Data Visualization

This program uses the numpy and matplotlib libraries to 
visualize data related to arrival times, queue times, and 
customer counts in a system.

## Installation 

To run this program, you must have the following libraries 
installed:

'numpy'
'matplotlib'

If you don't have them installed, you can install them using 
pip by running the following command:

'pip install numpy matplotlib'

## Running the Program and Usage

To run the program, navigate to where you saved 
'Part2Question1.py' in the terminal and use the following 
command to run:

'python Part2Question1.py'

The program defines several arrays of data, such as start 
times, exit times, time spent in queue, customers in the 
system, and customers in the queue, and creates scatter plots 
of each data set with respect to arrival time.

Each plot shows how the arrival time relates to the specific 
data set being analyzed. The x-axis represents the data set, 
while the y-axis represents the arrival time.

To see the plots, the plt.show() method must be called after 
each plot is created.
