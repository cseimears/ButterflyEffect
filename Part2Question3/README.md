# Part 2 Question 3

This program contains four parts, each with its own set of 
code to perform different calculations and generate 
visualizations.

Part a: It defines a range of values for variables p and k, 
creates a 2D grid of p and k values, and then applies an 
inequality to them. Finally, it plots the result of the 
inequality as an image.

Part b: It defines the range of arrival rates and a factor k, 
and then calculates and plots the throughput for different 
arrival rates as well as the new throughput with the factor k.

Part c: It defines the range of arrival and service rates, 
creates a 2D grid of lambda and mu values, calculates old and 
new probabilities, and then plots the new probability as an 
image.

Part d: It defines the range of arrival and service rates, 
creates a 2D grid of lambda and mu values, calculates the mean 
time in the system E[T] and the new E[T] with the factor k, 
and then plots them as images.

Each part of the program is independent of the others, and the 
code for each part is self-contained. The program requires 
numpy and matplotlib libraries to run, which are used for 
numerical calculations and plotting.
