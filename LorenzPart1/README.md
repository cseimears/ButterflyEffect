# Lorenz Attractor Visualization

This program visualizes the Lorenz system using the numpy, 
scipy, and matplotlib libraries. To run the program, first 
make sure you have these libraries installed. You can install 
them using the following commands in your terminal:

'pip install numpy'
'pip install scipy'
'pip install matplotlib'

# Running the Program

Once you have installed the libraries, you can run the program 
by executing the lorenz.py file in your terminal:

'python LorenzPart1.py'

This will open an animated 3D plot of the Lorenz system. The 
plot shows the trajectory of the system in blue, with a small 
red line segment highlighting the current position of the 
system. You can pause the animation by clicking on the plot, 
and resume it by clicking again.
